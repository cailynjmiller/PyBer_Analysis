# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
We have been tasked by the executive committee of PyBer to pull together an analysis of the three city types where Pyber operates (urban, suburban, and rural) to uncover any trends. They wanted to see two outputs, the first being a DataFrame with the 3 city types as the index and the total fares, total rides, total drivers, average fare per driver, and average fare per ride for each type. The second output is a multiple-line chart with each line representing a city type showing the total number of fares per week between January and April 2019.

## Results - Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
The majority of the revenue Pyber recieves comes from urban cities accounting for a little over 60% of the total revenue, about 30% from suburban cities, and less than 10% for rural cities. Urban cities also have the majority of total rides and total drivers and rural has the least. <br/>
Although fares from Urban cities account for the majority of the revenue, the margins are actually lower. The averege fare per ride in an urban city is only $24.53 as oppesed to suburban and rural cities where the average fares are $30.97 and $34.62. The drivers also, on average, make the least amount per ride in cities at $16 when the drivers in suburban and rural cities make much higher amounts per ride an average at $39.50 and $55.40.<br/>

When looking at the total weekly fares by city type for January through April, you notice that there doesn't appear to be a trend upward or downward for any of the suburban and rural cities. Urban cities appear to be trending slightly upward. There are spikes for all city types in the between February and March and dips in the middle of March. For urban cities fares per month tend to go up and down throughout the mid March and early April while suburban and rural cities stay about the same. For urban and rural cities, there appears to be a dip at the end of April.<br/>

## Summary - Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types
- An interesting observation can be made from the Summary DataFrame that Suburban and rural cities have less drivers than rides and urban cities have more drivers than rides. There is an excess of drivers in urban cities which is the reason why the average fare per driver is so low in urban cities. I would recommend incintivizing drivers to take shifts driving in suburban and rural cities in order to even out the average fares per ride and driver across the city types.
- The numbers of rides in rural and suburban cities is significantly lower than urban cities. This could be because, cultually, people who live in these types of cities are less likely to use ride share because people have to travel further distances and, therefore, have higher fare prices. In these types of cities, I recommend dicounting rides that go over a certain distance. For example, the first 3 miles are $x/mile and anything after that is $x-0.5/mile.
- Another reason the number of rides is significantly lower in suburban and rural cities is likely becaues, culturally, people would rather drive than take ride-shares. I would recommend gearing marketing resources towards people who live in these types of cities to show the environmental and personal benefits of using ride-share apps. I would also offer people in these areas a free first ride to get them to download the app and expose them to the business.
